# The Kedro starter

## Introduction

The code in this repository demonstrates best practice when working with Kedro and PySpark. It contains a Kedro starter template with some initial configuration and an example pipeline, and originates from the [Kedro documentation about how to work with PySpark](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/11_tools_integration/01_pyspark.html).
